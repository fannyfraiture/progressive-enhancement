<h3>The story</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.</p> 
<q>They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</q>
<q>The farmer said, “Maybe.”</q>
<p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,</p> 
<q>“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</q>
<q>The farmer again said, “Maybe.”</q>
<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, </p>
<q>“Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</q>
<q>and the farmer responded, “Maybe.”</q>
<p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,</p>
<q>“Isn’t that great!”</q> 
<q>Again, he said, “Maybe.”</q>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>

        <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

        Alan Watts</p>

<p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
